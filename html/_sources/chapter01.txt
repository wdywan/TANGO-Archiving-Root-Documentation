Before using Mambo, new user account needs to be created:
	1. Open mambo-rw.bat file located in %ARCHIVING_ROOT%/bin/win32
	2. Create a user account in the directory you want

Note that with the first opening of Mambo you'll get two error messages. This is normal because Mambo always tries to load a previous configuration (which doesn't exists yet). These messages won't appear next time.
