User Guide
==========
Before starting Mambo all of Tango Archiving Device Servers must be running. If your installation went fine, you'll be able to see them in Windows Services:

You should also ensure, that they're properly installed and working in Jive:

To run Mambo you can use either mambo-rw.bat or mambo.bat, however the second one only allows user to visualize archived data, while mambo-rw.bat allows to create an archiving configuration.

Before using Mambo, new user account needs to be created:
	1. Run mambo-rw.bat or mambo.bat file located in %ARCHIVING_ROOT%/bin/win32
	2. Create a user account in the desired directory

Note that with the first opening of Mambo you'll get two error messages:

   :align: center

This is normal because Mambo always tries to load a previous configuration (which doesn't exists yet). These messages won't appear next time and your Mambo will be ready to work with:
